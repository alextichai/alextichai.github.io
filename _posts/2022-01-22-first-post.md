We recently submitted a new paper using the eigenvector continuation (EC) approach as a resummation tool for divergent perturbation series. The anharmonic oscillator serves as a notoriously non-perturbative quantum system where standard perturbation theory breaks down. Within the EC approach we were able to obtain a rapidly convergent sequence that reproduces the exact energy up to arbitrary precision.
