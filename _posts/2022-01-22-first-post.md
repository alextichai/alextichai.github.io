title: New preprint on EC!
author: Alexander Tichai

We recently submitted a new paper using the eigenvector continuation (EC) approach as a resummation tool for divergent perturbation series. The anharmonic oscillator serves as a notoriously non-perturbative quantum system where standard perturbation theory breaks down. Within the EC approach we were able to obtain a rapidly convergent sequence that reproduces the exact energy up to arbitrary precision.

title: Perspectives in nuclear theory

In a recent preprint the nuclear community put forward a collection of short papers identifying future perspectives in nuclear structure research such as novel interaction developments, open problems in quantum many-body theory and rigorous quantification of theoretical uncertainties using statistically sound methods.
More concretely, we put forward ideas for simplifying the development process by open-sourcing relevant steps in the computational toolchain for nuclear structure calculations. For details check out the link to the preprint below!
