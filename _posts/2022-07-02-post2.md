In a recent preprint the nuclear community put forward a collection of short papers identifying future perspectives in nuclear structure research such as novel interaction developments, open problems in quantum many-body theory and rigoros quantification of theoretical uncertainties.
More concretely, we put forward ideas for simplifying the development process by open-sourcing relevant steps in the computational toolchain for nuclear structure calculations. For details check out the link to the preprint below!
