I completed my master studies in mathematics and physics at the TU Darmstadt in Germany.
Subsequently, I performed my doctoral studies in nuclear structure theory in the group of Prof. Robert Roth in the field of quantum many-body theory. After completing my doctoral studies in 2017, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at CEA Saclay, France, in the group of Prof. Thomas Duguet.
In 2019 I moved back to Germany to work as a post-doctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut fuer Kernphysik at Heidelberg in the group of Prof. Achim Schwenk. Since 2020 I work in the *STRONGINT* of Prof. Schwenk at TU Darmstadt.

My research is dedicated to the better understanding of the atomic nucleus following an *ab initio* paradigm.
Starting from the underlying field theory of quantum chromodynamics the inter-nuclear interaction is derived using chiral effective field theory, enabling systematic improvement for the interaction models.
The corresponding Hamiltonians are then used as input in a variety of many-body approaches for the solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation.

I am particularly interested in the description of strongly correlated medium-mass system using basis-expansion expansion methods. Such systems are particularly interesting (and challenging) because standard single-reference approaches start to break down, therefore, requiring the design of novel schemes for the treatment of such nuclei.
In recent years the use of symmetry-broken fameworks emerged as an particularly powerful tool for targeting open-shell systems.

In addition, one major challenge in contemporary many-body theory is related to the computational burden of storing and contracting (nuclear) many-body operators. To facilitate this, I have been working on approaches to reduce the computational requirement using big-data techniques. In recent years the use of tensor factorization techniques has shown to be very useful in reducing the memory footprint while only introducing a moderate approximation error.
Such strategies will be of particular relevance in the light of targeting deformed and/or heavy-mass nuclei in the future.
