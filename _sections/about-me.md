I completed my master studies in mathematics and physics at the TU Darmstadt in Germany.
Subsequently, I performed my doctoral studies in nuclear structure theory in the group of Prof. Robert Roth in the field of quantum many-body theory.

My research is dedicated to the better understanding of the atomic nucleus following an *ab initio* paradigm.
Starting from the underlying field theory of quantum chromodynamics the inter-nuclear interaction is derived using chiral effective field theory, enabling systematic improvement for the interaction models.
The corresponding Hamiltonians are then used as input in a variety for the solution of the Schr"odinger equation.

I am particularly interested in the description of strongly correlated medium-mass system using basis-expansion expansion methods. Such systems are particularly interesting (and challenging) because standard single-reference approaches start to break down, therefore, requiring the design of novel schemes for the treatment of such nuclei.
